# 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

 ## Category [brute force]
 
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

[LeetCode 209](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)
 
````
 Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
 Output: 2
 Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

 ### Complexity analysis
 - Time complexity: O(nlog(n))
 - Space complexity: O(n)
 
 Follow up:
  - If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).
